# E-Commerce Portfolio Project

## This is a back-end nodejs project for an e-commerce website.

### Current stage

- __To Do__:
    - [ ] __Create PostgreSQL database and tables__: Create a PostgreSQL database and add the tables from your design.
    - [ ] __Connect the app and database__: Set up your application to be able to interface with the PostgreSQL database.
    - [ ] __Plan API endpoints__: Plan the API endpoints that will be used in retrieving data from your database.
    - [ ] __Set up user registration__: Add the logic for handling registration of new users.
    - [ ] __Set up local login__: Add the logic for handling login using a username and password.
    - [ ]  __Set up product endpoints__: Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to products.
    - [ ]  __Set up user endpoints__: Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to users and their accounts.
    - [ ]  __Set up cart endpoint__: Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to a user’s cart.
    - [ ]  __Set up checkout endpoint__: Add the logic for handling checkout. There is no need to actually try and charge somebody yet; charging will come in a later evolution of this project. For now, we will assume that all charges succeed for ease of development (still add in error handling to account for times it doesn’t).
    - [ ]  __Set up order endpoint__: Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to orders.
    - [ ] __Document the API__: Document the API you have built by adding and configuring Swagger to your project.
    - [ ] __Next Steps__: You’re welcome to expand your API beyond these project tasks and get creative! A future portfolio project will build on top of what you have built here, covering tasks for creating the client side of your e-commerce application. If you don’t want to wait that long, you can try building out a client for your API on your own!


- __In Progress__:
    - [ ] __Design the database__: Plan out the different types of data the application will track and how those pieces of data relate.

- __Done__:
    - [x] __Set up version control__: Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.
    - [x] __Set up an Express server__: Create a directory for your project and set up a basic Express server.
